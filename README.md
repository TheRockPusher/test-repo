# Cookiecutter Python Package Template

This repository defines a [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) template for creating
a modern Python package with a `src/` layout, automated tooling, and optional license selection.

## Usage

```bash
cookiecutter .
```

Provide values for the prompted fields (project metadata, package import name, GitHub information, etc.).
The generator will scaffold a ready-to-use project inside a directory named after your chosen project slug.

After generation, refer to the rendered project's `README.md` for day-to-day development commands.
